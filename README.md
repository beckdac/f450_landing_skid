## Landing skid for F450 made from 3d printed parts and carbon fiber arrow shafts
---

Landing skid for F450 style quad.  Designed in OpenSCAD.  Latest version will always be on github: https://github.com/beckdac/f450_landing_skid

I used carbon fiber arrow shafts for the cross bars after stripping the fletching, nock, and tips, e.g. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PDAOHPQ .  The padding is pipe insulation from the local hardware store wrapped with warning tape.

Printed with 20% infill in PLA.  The idea is that this should break first, absorbing the impact of a hard landing, and not your quad.  The whole rig with arrow shafts and 3d printed parts weighs 64g  (56 for the printed parts).  I broke a set of skids in a 40 foot fall but the quad was fine, otherwise.
